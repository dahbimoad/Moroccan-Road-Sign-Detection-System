# Technical Approach

## Step-by-Step Approach to Build a Road Sign Detection System

### 1. Data Collection

- Collect images of Moroccan road signs
- Organize them by categories (warning, prohibition, obligation, information)
- Annotate images with bounding boxes around road signs
- Create a database of sign meanings and descriptions

### 2. Image Preprocessing

Apply these techniques to enhance image quality:
- Resizing to standardize input
- Color space conversion (RGB to HSV/LAB)
- Histogram equalization to improve contrast
- Noise reduction with Gaussian blur
- Edge detection (Canny, Sobel)

### 3. Sign Detection

Two main approaches:

**Traditional Image Processing:**
- Color-based segmentation (targeting red, blue, and yellow colors common in signs)
- Shape detection (circles, triangles, rectangles)
- Contour analysis
- BLOB (Binary Large Object) detection
- Hough Transform for geometric shape detection

**Machine Learning Approach:**
- HOG (Histogram of Oriented Gradients) + SVM (Support Vector Machine)
- Haar cascades
- Deep learning object detection (optional)

### 4. Feature Extraction

- Extract relevant features from detected sign regions:
  - Color histograms
  - Shape descriptors
  - SIFT/SURF features
  - HOG features
  - Moments (Hu moments, Zernike moments)

### 5. Sign Classification

- Template matching with known sign templates
- Machine learning classifiers:
  - Support Vector Machines (SVM)
  - Random Forests
  - k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)
- Deep learning classification (optional)

### 6. Real-time Processing

- Optimize algorithms for speed
- Implement multi-threading for parallel processing
- Consider skip-frame techniques
- Use region of interest (ROI) to focus processing

### 7. Result Presentation

- Annotate video feed with bounding boxes
- Display sign meaning and confidence level
- Keep history of recently detected signs
- Provide audio feedback (optional)

## Technology Stack

### Core Libraries

- **OpenCV**: The foundation for most image processing tasks
- **NumPy**: For efficient numerical operations
- **scikit-image**: For additional image processing algorithms
- **scikit-learn**: For machine learning models

### Implementation Considerations

1. Focus on traditional image processing techniques first:
   - Color-based segmentation
   - Edge detection
   - Shape analysis
   - Template matching

2. Start with static images, then move to video processing

3. Implement a simple UI to display results

4. Gradually optimize for real-time performance
