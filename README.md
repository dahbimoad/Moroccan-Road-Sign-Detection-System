# Moroccan Road Sign Detection System

This project aims to detect and interpret Moroccan road signs in real-time using computer vision and image processing techniques.

## Project Overview

The system will:
1. Capture video input from a camera
2. Process frames in real-time
3. Detect road signs using image processing techniques
4. Classify and interpret the meaning of detected signs
5. Display the results in a user interface
